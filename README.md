Close Price

Volume

Data can be obtained from reliable financial data sources such as Yahoo Finance

# DATA CLEANING:
Removed duplicates and filling of null values.

# Model Training:
I have employed  machine learning model to predict stock prices, including:

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks

# Evaluation:
The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) score.

# Results:

Below is a plot comparing the actual and predicted stock prices:
